# chessgame
A simple chess game has been developped in an educationnal purpose to improve my python skills.
For this project, no chess packages has been used. I completely wrote the chessEngine from scratch. There are two versions: 
  - 'ChessEngineA' is a more advanced algorithm
  - 'ChessEngineB' is a more simple algorithm

For the UI part, the python package pygame has been used. That will allow to manage the mouse event.
And Finally for the AI part has been written by applying the the Minimax algorithm. This work is still in progress.

This project would'nt been possible without the help of Eddie Sharick, a youtuber. The link to his video is:
